## Give

Rosie is a free, open-source project working to make health simpler for patients. 

MITRE is investing $800k in 2022. The project needs an additional $250k in community investments in Rosie (a tax deductible donation).

To contribute to the project, check out the [project github](https://github.com/Open-Health-Manager/).
