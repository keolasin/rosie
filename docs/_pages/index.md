## Welcome

Hello! My name is Rosie. I'm a health manager, and my goal is to make health simple.

How Rosie works:

- Rosie makes your health record.
- Rosie highlights missing info.
- Rosie asks questions.
- Rosie highlights preventative health care, just for you.
- Rosie learns what health you need.
- Rosie gets better all the time.
- Rosie nudges you to drive your primary self-care.

## Info

I make it easier to keep a patients health information in one place.

## Principles

I believe in Patient Data Ownership, so that patients are in the driver's seat of their health.
