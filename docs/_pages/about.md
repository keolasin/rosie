How Rosie works:

- Rosie learns what health you need.
- Rosie gets better all the time.
- Rosie nudges you to drive your primary self-care.

## 4 parts of Rosie:

1. The **Patient Data Use Agreement** (PDUA) is a contract between the patient and a service provider that states in clear, simple language or graphics, how data will be used and accessed.
2. The **Patient Data Manager** (PDM) is a digital service working on behalf of a patient to continually find, retrieve, add to, edit, correct, and normalize data and construct a personâ€™s longitudinal health record.
3. The **Standard Patient Health Record** (.sphr) is a complete, integrated and computable record in a standard representation that contains all the data relevant to an individuals health and healthcare.
4. The **Patient Data Receipt** (PDR) is a receipt generated at the result of every health transaction that sends it to a Patient Data Manager to update the Standard Patient Health Record.
