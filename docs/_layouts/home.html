  <h2>Rosie's Four Elements</h2>
  <section class="quad-container">
    <section class="quad-item">
      <h3>Patient Data Use Agreement (PDUA)</h3>
      <p>A contract between the patient and a service provider that states in clear, simple language or graphics, how data will be used and accessed. Patients need to own their health data. The PDUA’s contract assigns data ownership to the patient, and particular access rights to the patient-consented service.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="quad-item">
      <h3>Patient Data Manager (PDM)</h3>
      <p>Is a digital service working on behalf of a patient to continually find, retrieve, add, edit, correct, and normalize data and construct a person's longitudinal health record. Because a patient's data comes from many places, the PDM takes it and puts it into the same place (one, comprehensive health record).</p>
    </section>
    <section class="quad-item">
      <h3>Standard Patient Health Record (SPHR)</h3>
      <p>A digital "twin" of the patient in code, based on a nationally shared and consistent definition of health data (structure, terminology, content). This specification contains definitions for all critical patient information such as ID, emergency care, primary care, oncology care, with future extensions for human biology, behavior, environment, and social circumstances.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="quad-item">
      <h3>Health Manager (HM)</h3>
      <p>Is the front-end service on your mobile phone (or other silicon) that guides you to take actions for your health. Tailored education, involving family and clinical teams, and giving daily health ownership to the individual. (And an extra sentence or two here so that we can give this section of the page more balance next to SPHR’s blurb)</p>
